# Pong Game in JS

I have used the P5 JS framework https://p5js.org/

I am still struggling to find a solution for beat the the player 2, and also it has a bug sometimes tha ball got stuck beetween the bar and wall incriasing the scores very fast.

Please, feel freen to contribute with this study project.
